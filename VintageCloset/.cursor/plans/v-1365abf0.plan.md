# Landing Page Polish Plan

## 1. Hero Revamp (`src/components/landing/Hero.tsx`)

- Add two secondary image cards behind the primary hero shot (left/right) with staggered z-index, drop shadows, and slight rotation for "3-picture" effect.
- Rebalance layout spacing for desktop vs mobile (headline width, CTA placement) and ensure gradients/eyebrow text align with new imagery.
- Enhance CTA buttons with consistent sizing and add subtle hover shadow.

## 2. Layout & Spacing Cleanup

- `CalloutBanner.tsx`: tighten padding, align text/CTA vertically on mobile, ensure gradient matches accent palette.
- `MediaCarousel.tsx`: adjust card widths/margins, add soft shadow and consistent caption placement; ensure placeholder states don’t show grey blocks.
- `CollectionHighlights.tsx` & `GeneratedListingPreview.tsx`: refine grid gaps, ensure text columns align with viewport max widths.
- `Stats.tsx`, `JournalEventsTeaser.tsx`, `CallToAction.tsx`: polish spacing, lighten backgrounds, and balance typography for floating feel.

## 3. “From Vienna, With Love” Card Redesign (`StoreStory.tsx`)

- Replace current bordered card with glassmorphism style: translucent backdrop, gradient accent line, minimal icon.
- Update typography hierarchy (eyebrow, headline, body) and CTA style (“Read our Journal”) to feel lighter and more modern.

## 4. Global Landing Page Touches

- Review section ordering/padding in `src/app/page.tsx` to ensure consistent rhythm between blocks.
- Verify responsive layouts (mobile/tablet/desktop) and adjust Tailwind utility classes to keep content centered and airy.
- Confirm scroll reveals trigger smoothly with new spacing.

## Todos
